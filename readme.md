### <i><b>About This Project</b></i>
Hello everyone ! <br/> <br/>
As part of my software engineering course, i was tasked to make a simple websiite based of HTML. It was pretty challenging as a beginner, but i find it pretty enjoyable so far.On this project, i'm trying to make a photography website dedicated for aviation. This website will also provide spaces for discussing any other aviation related subjects.

In this file, i will explain and describe the process that i went through while developing this site. I've divided my HTML index file to at least 4 different sections. The file are divided into 5 sections which includes:
<ul> <li>Head</li>
<li>Body</li>
<li>Main</li>
<li>Footer</li>

### <i><b>Head</b></i> <br/>
This section was pretty straight forward. I've added an airplane icon by using the HTML link and add "icon' as the value. The png files (and other images used on this site) are placed on "images" folder located on "revou-2024-project". I then assigned the png file by using "img src=" tag. I also set the viewpoint so that the site will be viewable in any device.

### <i><b>Body</b></i> <br/>

In the body section, i've put 3 different section which comprises of 3 different class. This includes logo, nav and form sections. I add an hyperlink on "Home" & "About Us" on both Nav section (top & bottom). I assigned "profile.html" file using href tag and it will prompt the page to move to "About Us" page. If the user wanted to get back to the "index.html", they can click on the "Home" link on both nav sections.

### <i><b>Main</b></i> <br/>

I divided the main into 3 section. On the first section, i added a introductory paragraph. On the second section, i add 3 photo's that showcase the type of content that the user will see on the website. I added caption on each photo by using figure and figcaption tag. The last section on the body is another form tag that i add to give an opportunity to user to register to the site. There are 5 form that i added which includes:
<ul> <li>Name</li>
<li>Email</li>
<li>Birthday</li>
<li>sex</li>
<li>Textarea</li></ul>

I used the same tag to make the name and email form with an additional date form. As for the sex form, i use the radio button and assign female and male as the value. Furthermore, i add textarea which ask user to write their reason on joining the website. This section was ended by adding a submit button.

### <i><b>Footer</b></i> <br/><br/>

In this section, i pretty much copy the nav top tags. The reason why i put another nav section here is for easier accesibility for the user.
